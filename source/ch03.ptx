  <title>Probability</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Probability forms the foundation of statistics, and you're probably already
      aware of many of the ideas presented in this chapter. However, formalization 
      of probability concepts is likely new for most readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this chapter provides a theoretical foundation for the ideas in later 
      chapters and provides a path to a deeper understanding, mastery of the concepts 
      introduced in this chapter is not required for applying the methods introduced 
      in the rest of this book.

    <title>Defining probability</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Statistics is based on probability, and while probability is not required 
        for the applied techniques in this book, it may help you gain a deeper 
        understanding of the methods and set a better foundation for future courses.

            A "die", the singular of dice, is a cube with six faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
            What is the chance of getting 1 when rolling a die?

    <title>Sampling from a small population</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        When we sample observations from a population, usually we're only sampling 
        a small fraction of the possible individuals or cases. However, sometimes 
        our sample size is large enough or the population is small enough that we 
        sample more than 10% of a population without replacement.

          Professors sometimes select a student at random to answer a question. 
          If each student has an equal chance of being selected and there are 15 
          people in your class, what is the chance that she will pick you for 
          the next question?

    <title>Random variables</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        It's often useful to model a process using what's called a random variable. 
        Such a model allows us to apply a mathematical framework and statistical 
        principles for better understanding and predicting outcomes in the real world.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        So far in this chapter we've discussed cases where the outcome of a 
        variable is discrete. In this section, we consider a context where 
        the outcome is a continuous numerical variable.
